First Assignment 

This basic website is the first exercice of the NodeJS course.

The run instructions are extremly simple:
	- launching with "nodemon index" OR "node index"
	- first page explains how it all works
	- type /hello to have a generic greeting
	- type /hello?name=... to have a personalized greeting
	- type /hello?name=arnaud to have a (really) short introduction
	- Error 404 will be written if you type anything else.
