Second Week - Exercice 1

This exercice's goal is to learn how to make routing and server setup easier with ExpressJS and EJS.

The run instructions are extremly simple:
	- launching with "nodemon index" OR "node index"
	- first page explains how it all works
	- type /hello/your_name to access a second page where you'll find personalized greetings and a button*
	- once pressed the button will display metrics stored locally
