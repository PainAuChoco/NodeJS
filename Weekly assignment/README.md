Second Week - Exercice 2

This exercice's goal is to learn how to use TypeScript

The run instructions are extremly simple:
	- launching with "npm start"
	- first page explains how it all works
	- type /hello/your_name to access a second page where you'll find personalized greetings and a button
	- once pressed the button will display metrics stored locally
